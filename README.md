# cvad-selfservice-microapp
A very hacky, very not-production-ready powershell bundle for a self-service Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops microapp that enables end-users to control their CVAD Sessions and Machines, from Workspace, with Microapps.

This is absolutely NOT supported by Citrix. At all. It was thrown together for a Citrix-internal hackathon. It works, but shouldn't be relied upon :)
